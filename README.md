# Heroes of the Storm Replay Analyzer

This repository contains scripts to analyze replay files from the game Heroes of the Storm. The scripts extract player statistics and save them in a structured format for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (for running the bash script)
- .NET Core SDK (for running the `heroes-decode` command)
- Python   3.x (for running the Python script)
- Pandas library (Python package)

## Usage

1. **Extract Player Statistics**: Run the bash script to decode the replay files and extract player statistics. This will create a CSV file named `combined_output.csv`.

bash ./extract_player_stats.sh


2. **Process Player Statistics**: Run the Python script to process the extracted player statistics and structure them into a new CSV file named `structured_data3.csv`.

python python process_player_stats.py


## Script Details

### Bash Script (`extract_player_stats.sh`)

The bash script performs the following tasks:

- Defines the directory where the replay files are located.
- Creates an empty output CSV file named `combined_output.csv`.
- Loops through all `.StormReplay` files in the specified directory.
- Executes the `dotnet heroes-decode` command to decode each replay file and appends the output to the CSV file.
- Removes any strange characters from the CSV file using `sed`.

The bash script is adapted from the [HeroesToolChest/HeroesDecode](https://github.com/HeroesToolChest/HeroesDecode) repository.

### Python Script (`process_player_stats.py`)

The Python script processes the `combined_output.csv` file generated by the bash script and performs the following tasks:

- Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
- Initializes variables to store structured player data.
- Iterates over each row in the DataFrame to extract player names and their corresponding statistics.
- Determines the winner based on the order of the teams.
- Structures the data into a list of dictionaries and converts it back into a DataFrame.
- Exports the structured data to a new CSV file named `structured_data3.csv`.
